# GenAsm
An extensible assembler project with an ARM Thumb-1 instruction set example implementation.

This project is meant as a learning tool to help people understand how to write an assembler. 
The assembler uses multiple scans to simplify the amount of work done in each scan. It also generates a 
number of output files so that the state of the assembler can be analyzed at different points in the assembly process.
